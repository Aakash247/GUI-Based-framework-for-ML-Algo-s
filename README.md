# GUI-Based-framework-for-ML-Algo-s
Minor project on Graphical User Interface for Machine Learning Algorithms using streamlit python library


The GUI Based Application Framework has a lot of application in the real world. The final aim of the project is that the user can input custom dataset and to visualize the machine learning algorithms and to predict the values or to classify, and to check accuracy of the models saving us from tedious coding work.

As this works with custom dataset it has multiple real time applications in the field of medical diagnostics, research, media, etc.
